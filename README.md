# micro-journal

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## intro

micro-journal is my take on a small, light-weight and easy to use journaling system aimed to help people
keep on top of their schedule & manage their life. 

written 100% in python, micro-journal is a simple CLI app that will run in your terminal
and save all of your notes, todos and brain-dumps in a local sqlite database.

## features

* set daily, weekly or monthly journal logs  and label them with timestamps, labels, importance markers and due dates - all written in a quick & concise way.
* show all current logs, filter them by label or importance, preview a set number (whether past or future), or check which are still outstanding.
* customise everything that you would want to - custom labels, maximum journal length, even set your own motivational quotes.
* view a summary of the last 30 days for  a feel-good summary and see what you accomplished in that time.
