# micro-journal
A really simple journalling system; log your thoughts, diarise your plans and keep track of your schedule!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

micro-journal is my take on a small, light-weight and easy to use journalling system aimed to help people
manage their life. Written 100% in python, micro-journal is a simple CLI app that will run in your terminal
and save all of your notes, todos and brain-dumps in a local sqlite database.
